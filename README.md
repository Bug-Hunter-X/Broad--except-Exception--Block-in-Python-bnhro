This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in Python exception handling.  The example uses a broad `except Exception` block, which, while seemingly convenient, masks more specific error types. This practice hinders debugging by preventing the identification of the exact error cause. This example provides a corrected version, demonstrating best practices in exception handling. The corrected version handles specific exceptions to ensure more informative error messages and aids in debugging.
